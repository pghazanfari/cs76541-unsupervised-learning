The code for this assignment is run as 2 Jupyter notebook (one for each dataset).
It can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/pghazanfari/cs76541-supervised-learning

Steps to run notebook:

* Set up a python env using the requirements.txt
    * Virtualenv instructions: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
    * Can alternatively use Conda/Miniconda
* Activate the environment
* Run Jupyter (cmd: jupyter notebook)
* Open the localhost Jupyter address in your browser (it should print out the port in the terminal as part of running jupyter)
* Open either 'heart_disease.ipynb' or 'stroke.ipynb' and run all cells
* Repeat last step for opposing notebook

Note: It may take some time to run the notebooks, but it shouldn't take hours.
